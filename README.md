# VB.NET-Block-Game

This basic VB.NET game was developed in Visual Studio.  For this project, I mainly focused on making animations and movements of the player and sprites using timers instead of loops.  This created numerous challenges to overcome, but nonetheless is functional.  Program is marked up with descriptive comments on what each piece of code does.  I am open to suggestions, but I am more of a Python Developer and only use VB.NET for fun side projects.
