CURRENT KNOWN BUGS IN THE PROGRAM:

UPDATES AS OF 12/10/2020
1) After unpausing game, the player jumps.  This can cause the player to crash into sprites and lose.
2) If the player holds the jump button for too long, they can jump out of the game infinitely.
3) Duck function doesn't work (Where the player can duck under some sprites).  Instead of properly ducking, the player's character will lower its size upwards instead of downwards.
4) Gives coins too frequently (Minor issue, not as important as the other bugs).
5) Player can unpause the game by pressing any regular in-game buttons, such as UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT.
